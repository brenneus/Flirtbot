# Flirtbot
A RAG Enhanced Chatbot for Romantic Conversations. The goal of this project was simply to get a feel for how RAG systems work and develop a simple RAG system capable of retrieving information from an external source. 

## How to use the flirtbot
In order to test the flirtbot, first clone the repo and save it on your local computer. Get an OpenAI API key and enter it in flirtbot.py (where it currently says 'Enter your own API key here'). Next, open up a new terminal shell and run python3 flirtbot.py. You should be prompted to enter some background information and the flirtbot should return some flirtacious sentences to choose from.
