# Flirtbot
A RAG Enhanced Chatbot for Romantic Conversations. 
The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and to build a simple example capable of retrieving relevant information from an external source.

## How to use the flirtbot
To test Flirtbot:
1.	Clone the repository and save it to your local machine.
2.	Obtain an OpenAI API key and enter it into flirtbot.py (where it currently says 'Enter your own API key here').
3.	Open a new terminal shell and run:
python3 flirtbot.py

You’ll be prompted to enter some background information, and the chatbot will return several flirtatious responses to choose from.

## The Database
For the RAG system, I used Love is Blind transcripts available online at: https://tvshowtranscripts.ourboard.org/viewforum.php?f=1243

Each episode is hosted on a separate page, so the dialogue had to be extracted individually. A custom script was written to automate this process. 

## Brief File Description
Below is a brief description of the repository and how to replicate the results shown.
**Building the text database**
1. create_texts.py
Extracts text from each episode. To use this script, modify the url and output name in the main function. The script will save all dialogue into a .txt file in the texts folder.
2. combine_text.py
Combines all files in the texts folder into one consolidated text file.
3. transcipts.txt
Contains the full compiled dialogue from the texts folder. This file is generated by running combine_text.py.
**Creating the Vector Database (ChromaDB)**
1. create_chromadb.py
Builds a persistent vector database using ChromaDB. It takes transcripts.txt, splits it into sentence chunks, and embeds each one for semantic similarity comparisons within the RAG system.
2. DB_info.py
A simple helper file for inspecting the ChromaDB database. This was mainly used during development to verify the stored data.
**Developing the RAG system**
1. flirtbot.py
The main script of the project. It implements the core RAG logic by combining a retriever (to find semantically similar text) with a generator (to create responses based on those retrieved sentences and the user’s prompt).
Some prompt engineering was used to align the chatbot’s output with the project’s romantic theme.
## Future Work
1.	Expand the dataset to include a wider range of sources, improving context and response quality.
2.	Compare the OpenAI API-based model with a locally hosted LLM that does not require API credits.
3.	Develop a simple web interface to make Flirtbot more accessible and user-friendly.
